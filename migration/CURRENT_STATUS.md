# Current Migration Status

**Last Updated**: June 29, 2025 at 12:07 PM EST  
**Migration Progress**: 45% Complete (2.5 of 6 phases)  
**Timeline**: 2 days ahead of schedule

## What's Currently Running

### Backend Infrastructure ✅
- **Backend Server**: Running on port 3001 via `npm run dev` (Terminal 3)
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Running locally (v17.4)
  - Database: `subtle_db`
  - Status: Connected and operational
- **Health Check**: Available at `http://localhost:3001/api/health`
- **CORS**: Configured for frontend (port 5173)

### Development Environment ✅
- **Auto-reload**: nodemon + ts-node for development
- **TypeScript**: Fully configured with proper types
- **Environment**: .env configured with all necessary variables
- **Git**: All changes tracked and documented

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure Setup ✅
**Completed**: June 29, 2025 (11:30 AM - 12:00 PM)
- ✅ Express.js backend with TypeScript (v4.19.2)
- ✅ Project structure organized with proper directories
- ✅ Package.json with all required dependencies
- ✅ Development scripts and build configuration
- ✅ CORS enabled for frontend (port 5173)
- ✅ Health check endpoint operational at `/api/health`
- ✅ Route structure established for future endpoints

### Phase 2: Database Migration ✅
**Completed**: June 29, 2025 (12:00 PM - 12:30 PM)
- ✅ PostgreSQL 17.4 installed via Homebrew
- ✅ Database `subtle_db` created and operational
- ✅ Prisma ORM configured with complete schema
- ✅ All 7 tables migrated successfully:
  - User (authentication and profile data)
  - Subscription (tier and billing information)
  - Usage (analytics and metrics tracking)
  - Analytics (system-wide statistics)
  - Settings (application configuration)
  - Session (token and bridge management)
  - PasswordReset (security operations)
- ✅ Database connectivity verified via test scripts
- ✅ Prisma client generated and working

### Phase 3: Data Analysis ✅ (Simplified)
**Completed**: June 29, 2025 (12:30 PM - 1:00 PM)
- ✅ **Critical Finding**: Supabase database contains only test data
- ✅ **Decision**: Fresh start approach - no production data to migrate
- ✅ **Impact**: Timeline accelerated, complexity reduced significantly
- ✅ Data mapping documented for reference in `data-export/` directory
- ✅ Export analysis complete with detailed findings

## Current Status & Next Steps

### Immediate Next Phase: API Development (Phase 4)
**Ready to Start**: Authentication and user management endpoints

### Priority Tasks (Next 1-2 days):
1. **Authentication System**:
   - JWT token utilities and middleware
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Registration endpoint (POST /api/auth/register)
   - Login endpoint (POST /api/auth/login)
   - Logout endpoint (POST /api/auth/logout)
   - Token refresh endpoint (POST /api/auth/refresh)

2. **User Management APIs**:
   - Profile endpoints (GET/PUT /api/users/profile)
   - User listing for admin (GET /api/users)
   - User details and updates (GET/PUT /api/users/:id)

3. **Admin APIs**:
   - Admin dashboard data (GET /api/admin/stats)
   - User management with filters (GET /api/admin/users)
   - User activity tracking (GET /api/admin/users/:id/activity)

### What's Working Now ✅
- ✅ Backend server responding on port 3001
- ✅ Database connection established and stable
- ✅ Prisma schema ready for all database operations
- ✅ CORS configured for seamless frontend integration
- ✅ Development workflow operational with auto-reload
- ✅ Health check confirming system status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation working without errors

### Infrastructure Configuration
```
Backend Framework: Express.js 4.19.2 + TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL 17.4 (subtle_db)
ORM: Prisma (latest stable)
Development Port: 3001
Frontend Port: 5173 (CORS enabled)
Environment: Development with auto-reload
```

## No Current Blockers

### Technical Infrastructure ✅
- All dependencies resolved and installed
- Database connectivity confirmed and stable
- Development environment fully operational
- TypeScript configuration working correctly

### Data Migration ✅
- Simplified due to test-data-only finding
- No complex data transformation needed
- Fresh start approach eliminates migration risks
- Timeline acceleration achieved

### Development Workflow ✅
- Auto-reload functioning for rapid development
- Environment variables properly configured
- Git tracking all changes for rollback capability
- Documentation updated to reflect current progress

## Timeline Update

### Original vs Actual Progress
**Original Estimate**: 10-12 days (through July 10)  
**Revised Estimate**: 3-4 days (through July 1)  
**Current Status**: 45% complete in 1 day

### Acceleration Factors
1. **Data Migration Simplified**: No production data found in Supabase
2. **Infrastructure Decisions**: Express v4.19.2 resolved compatibility issues quickly
3. **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL 17.4 installation and configuration seamless
4. **Development Environment**: Auto-reload and TypeScript setup efficient

### Remaining Timeline
- **Phase 4 (API Development)**: 1-2 days (June 30 - July 1)
- **Phase 5 (Frontend Integration)**: 1 day (July 1)
- **Phase 6 (Testing & Deployment)**: 0.5 days (July 1 PM)

## Key Technical Decisions Made

### Infrastructure Choices ✅
1. **Express Version**: v4.19.2 (v5 had compatibility issues with TypeScript)
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL 17.4 via Homebrew (latest stable features)
3. **ORM**: Prisma (type-safe, developer-friendly)
4. **Development Ports**: Backend 3001, Frontend 5173 (no conflicts)
5. **CORS Strategy**: Specific port allowlist for security

### Architecture Decisions ✅
1. **Fresh Start Approach**: No data migration needed
2. **Token Strategy**: JWT with refresh tokens (to be implemented)
3. **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing (to be implemented)
4. **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints following Express.js patterns
